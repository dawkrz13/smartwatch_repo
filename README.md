So far, the following tools are needed to build the project:
* **GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain.**
 - set up the path to the *bin* folder of the toolchain as an environmental variable,
* **Make.**
 - one way is to install *MinGW*, launch *MinGw Installation Manager* and install *msys-base* and *msys-make* packages,
 - remember to set up the path to *bin* folder inside *msys* folder as an environmental variable,

To build the project enter the *discovery-f407g* or *nucleo-l476rg* folder and run `make` from the terminal.
